This file describes the portions of the VX4000 memory map that have been reverse-engineered.

The memory map is stored in a .c49 file created by the CE49 programming software.  By changing parameters in the CE49 software and saving a new .c49 file with the changes, memory locations for different settings can be determined.

The .c49 file is a binary file that can be viewed in a hex editor program.  Big Endian format is used throughout.  

## Overview
The VX4000 has 250 programmable memory locations.  Each memory can store various parameters such as Receive Frequency, Transmit Frequency, RX and TX CTCSS or DCS tone, bandwidth, power level, etc.

## Scanning
The VX4000 has two different scan tables - User Scan and Dealer Scan.  These tables control which channels will be scanned when the corresponding scan mode is activated by button press.

### User Scan Table
The User Scan table starts at location 0x3224.  Each bit is one channel.  0 = User scan enable, 1 = disabled
250 channels = 31 full bytes plus first two bits of 32nd byte => 0x3224 to 0x3243

### Dealer Scan Table
The Dealer Scan table starts at 0x3266 with same usage and pattern as the User Scan table.

### Group Channel Allocations
Memory locations 0x3286 to 0x329E store Group Channel allocations.  One byte is allocated per group with the byte indicating the number of channels allocated to that group.  

Per documentation, the 250 total channels can be allocated across 20 groups.  However, the memory map allocates for 250 groups.

### Group Names / Alpha Tags
Memory locations 0x388 to 0xB57 store Group alpha tags.  8 Characters/bytes for an alpha tag per group with space for 250 groups.

### Radio Band Limits
0x3138 to 0x313B: lower band limit (4 byte int big endian)
0x313C to 0x313F: upper band limit (4 byte int big endian)
